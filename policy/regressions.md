# Regressions

For regression bugs in Mozilla-Central, our policy is to tag the bug as a regression, identify the commits which caused the regression, then mark the bugs associated with those commits as causing the regression. 

## What is a regresssion?

A regression is a bug, introduced by new code, which breaks existing functionality.

## Policy

_Regression bugs are identified by the _Regression_ keyword._

_If it is not immediately known which commit caused a regression, the _Regressionwindow-Wanted_ keyword should be added to the bug._

_Once the commit or commits which caused the regression are identififed, â€¦_
